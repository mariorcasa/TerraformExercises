# TerraformExercises
This repository contains Terraform examples for deploying infrastructure across multiple cloud platforms.

Each exercise within this repository has its own dedicated README file, providing detailed instructions and requirements.

The initial segments of these README files, including instructions and requirements, were generated by an AI. Subsequently, these exercises were completed by me.
